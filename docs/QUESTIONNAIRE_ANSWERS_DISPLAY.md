# Questionnaire Answers Display Feature

## Overview

The Benefit Eligibility Results page now includes a card that displays the questionnaire answers entered by the user during the assessment. This provides transparency and allows users to review the information that was used to determine their eligibility.

## Implementation

### Component: `QuestionnaireAnswersCard`

**Location**: `src/components/results/QuestionnaireAnswersCard.tsx`

**Features**:
- Displays all answered questions from the questionnaire flow
- Formats values appropriately based on input type (currency, numbers, booleans, selects, etc.)
- Shows question labels in a user-friendly format
- Only displays questions that have been answered (non-empty values)
- Includes assessment completion timestamp
- Responsive grid layout for optimal viewing on different screen sizes
- Print-friendly styling

### Value Formatting

The component intelligently formats different types of values:

- **Currency**: Displays with dollar sign and comma separators (e.g., "$30,000")
- **Numbers**: Displays with comma separators for readability (e.g., "4,500")
- **Booleans**: Shows "Yes" or "No" instead of true/false
- **Select/Radio**: Displays the option label instead of the raw value
- **Multi-select/Checkbox**: Shows comma-separated option labels
- **Dates**: Formats as localized date strings
- **Text**: Displays as-is

### Integration

The component is integrated into the results page in `src/App.tsx` and appears between the `ResultsSummary` and the program cards, providing context for the eligibility results.

### Usage

```tsx
import { QuestionnaireAnswersCard } from './components/results';

// In your component
<QuestionnaireAnswersCard />
```

### Accessibility

- Uses semantic HTML with `<dt>` and `<dd>` elements for question-answer pairs
- Includes proper ARIA labels and screen reader support
- Maintains keyboard navigation compatibility
- Follows WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### Styling

- Uses Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Consistent with the application's design system
- Print-friendly styles for document generation
- Responsive grid layout (1 column on mobile, 2 columns on desktop)

## Benefits

1. **Transparency**: Users can see exactly what information was used for their assessment
2. **Verification**: Users can verify their answers were recorded correctly
3. **Reference**: Provides a quick reference for the assessment data
4. **Trust**: Builds confidence in the assessment process by showing the underlying data

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:
- Allow users to edit answers and re-run the assessment
- Export the questionnaire answers as part of the results export
- Add search/filter functionality for large questionnaires
- Include validation status for each answer
