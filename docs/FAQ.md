## About Eligibility

### Does this guarantee I'll get benefits?

**No.** BenefitFinder:
- ‚úÖ Tells you IF you might qualify
- ‚úÖ Shows likelihood (High/Medium/Low confidence)
- ‚ùå Does NOT guarantee approval

The program office makes the final decision.

### Why does it say "Maybe" or "Likely"?

**We're being honest about uncertainty:**
- "Qualified" = Meet all clear requirements
- "Likely" = Meet most requirements, very probable
- "Maybe" = Need more information to be sure

When in doubt, **apply anyway** - it doesn't hurt to try!

### What if I don't qualify for anything?

**You still have options:**

1. **Check if results are correct**
   - Review your answers
   - Try again if you made mistakes

2. **Look for other resources:**
   - Food banks (no eligibility needed)
   - Community health centers
   - Emergency assistance programs
   - Call 211 for local help

3. **Plan for the future:**
   - If income drops, check again
   - If situation changes, recheck
   - Eligibility can change quickly

4. **Get help from an expert:**
   - Benefits counselors can find programs you might have missed
   - Legal aid can help with complex situations

### How accurate are the results?

**Very accurate!** We use official government rules, but:
- ‚úÖ Based on official eligibility criteria
- ‚úÖ Updated regularly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Final decision is made by program office
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Special circumstances may apply

**Always apply even if unsure!**
