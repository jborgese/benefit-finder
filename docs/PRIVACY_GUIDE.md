**Your Privacy Matters**

This guide explains how BenefitFinder protects your privacy and keeps your information safe.

---

## Quick Summary

✅ **Your information stays on YOUR device**
✅ **Nothing is sent to the internet**
✅ **We don't track you**
✅ **You control all your data**
✅ **Everything is encrypted (locked) for security**

---

## How Your Privacy Is Protected

### 1. Everything Stays Local

**What this means:**
- When you answer questions, answers are saved on YOUR device
- When you see results, calculations happen on YOUR device
- When you save results, they're stored on YOUR device
- **Nothing leaves your phone/computer**

**Why this matters:**
- No one can intercept your information
- No server has your data
- No company collects your information
- You're in complete control

**In simple terms:**
Think of it like using a calculator - your calculations stay on the calculator, they're not sent anywhere. BenefitFinder works the same way!

### 2. No Tracking or Analytics

**We don't track:**
- ❌ Who you are
- ❌ Where you live
- ❌ What you search for
- ❌ When you use the app
- ❌ What results you get

**Why this is unusual:**
Most apps track everything. We don't. We believe your privacy is more important than our data collection.

### 3. Encryption (Security Locks)

**What is encryption?**
Think of it like a locked safe:
- Your information is put in a safe (encrypted)
- Only you have the key (your password/device)
- Even if someone steals the safe, they can't open it

**What we encrypt:**
- Your saved results
- Your exported files (.bfx)
- Your personal information
- Everything sensitive

**Encryption strength:**
- Military-grade (AES-256)
- Same encryption used by banks
- Extremely secure

### 4. You Control Everything

**You decide:**
- ✅ When to save results
- ✅ When to delete results
- ✅ What to export
- ✅ Who to share with
- ✅ When to clear everything

**We never:**
- ❌ Save without asking
- ❌ Share without permission
- ❌ Keep backups on servers
- ❌ Recover deleted data
