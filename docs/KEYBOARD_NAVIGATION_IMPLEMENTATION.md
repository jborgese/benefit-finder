   - Added arrow key support to all selectable components
   - Implemented Home/End key navigation
   - Added visual focus indicators
   - Ensured proper focus management

4. **Implemented Enter Key Submission**
   - Standardized Enter key handling across all components
   - Added Space key as alternative selection method
   - Integrated with existing question flow navigation
   - Maintained backward compatibility

5. **Tested Keyboard Accessibility**
   - Created comprehensive test suite
   - Verified WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
   - Tested with screen readers
   - Validated cross-browser compatibility

## Technical Implementation

### New Components Created

#### `useKeyboardNavigation` Hook
```typescript
// Standardized keyboard navigation hook
const keyboardNav = useKeyboardNavigation({
  itemCount: options.length,
  enabled: !disabled,
  wrap: true,
  onItemSelect: (index) => handleSelection(index),
  onEnterKey: onEnterKey,
});
```

**Features:**
- Arrow key navigation (↑/↓, ←/→)
- Home/End key support
- Enter/Space key selection
- Focus management
- Visual focus indicators
- Screen reader announcements

### Updated Components

#### SelectInput (Radio Variant)
- ✅ Arrow key navigation between radio options
- ✅ Enter key selection
- ✅ Visual focus indicators
- ✅ Wrap-around navigation
- ✅ Home/End key support

#### MultiSelectInput (Checkbox Variant)
- ✅ Arrow key navigation between checkboxes
- ✅ Enter key toggle selection
- ✅ Visual focus indicators
- ✅ Multi-selection support

#### MultiSelectInput (Pills Variant)
- ✅ Arrow key navigation between pill buttons
- ✅ Enter key toggle selection
- ✅ Visual focus indicators
- ✅ Button-style navigation

#### NumberInput
- ✅ Arrow key increment/decrement (existing)
- ✅ Enter key submission
- ✅ Stepper button navigation

### Standardized Navigation Keys

| Key | Action | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate options | Move between selectable options |
| `←` / `→` | Navigate options | Alternative navigation (horizontal layouts) |
| `Home` | First option | Jump to first selectable option |
| `End` | Last option | Jump to last selectable option |
| `Enter` | Select/Submit | Select focused option or submit question |
| `Space` | Select/Submit | Alternative selection method |
| `Tab` | Next element | Standard tab navigation |
| `Shift+Tab` | Previous element | Reverse tab navigation |
