---

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Design Decisions

### 1. No External APIs âœ…
**Decision**: All rules are static JSON files, not fetched from APIs

**Rationale**:
- Maintains privacy (no external calls reveal user location/data)
- Ensures offline-first functionality
- Provides reliability (no API downtime)
- Supports field deployment in low-connectivity areas

**Approach**:
- Research official sources manually
- Encode eligibility criteria as JSON Logic
- Include source citations for traceability
- Update via app releases or rule packages

### 2. Comprehensive Source Citations âœ…
**Decision**: Every rule must include citations

**Rationale**:
- Enables verification of rule accuracy
- Provides transparency to users
- Supports appeals and documentation
- Facilitates rule updates

**Format**:
```json
{
  "citations": [
    {
      "title": "Official source name",
      "url": "https://official.gov/page",
      "legalReference": "7 CFR Â§ 273.9",
      "date": "2024-10-01",
      "notes": "Additional context"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Embedded Test Cases âœ…
**Decision**: Test cases are embedded in rule definitions

**Rationale**:
- Rules and tests stay synchronized
- Enables validation during rule authoring
- Supports automated testing
- Documents expected behavior

**Coverage**:
- Eligible cases (should pass)
- Ineligible cases (should fail)
- Boundary/edge cases (at exact thresholds)

### 4. Federal Baseline First âœ…
**Decision**: Start with federal rules, then add state variations

**Rationale**:
- Federal rules apply across all states
- Provides baseline for state customizations
- Easier to maintain consistent structure
- State rules can reference federal baseline

**Future**:
- Phase 1.5 continuation: Add GA, CA, NY state-specific rules
- Create state rule files that extend federal rules

---

## ðŸ”„ Alignment with Privacy Principles

This implementation strictly adheres to project principles:

### Privacy First âœ…
- **No external API calls**: All rules are static files
- **No tracking**: Rule files don't phone home
- **No telemetry**: No usage data sent externally
- **Local evaluation**: All logic runs in browser

### Offline First âœ…
- **Works without internet**: Rules bundled with app
- **No connectivity required**: JSON Logic evaluates locally
- **Field deployment ready**: Can be used in remote areas
- **Device-to-device distribution**: Rules can sync peer-to-peer

### Verifiable & Transparent âœ…
- **Open source**: Rules are visible and auditable
- **Cited sources**: Every rule links to official sources
- **Test cases**: Expected behavior is documented
- **Version controlled**: Changes are tracked in git

- âœ… Enables community contributions

The system is ready for:
1. Adding state-specific variations
2. Building the results display UI
3. Field testing with real users
4. Community rule contributions

**All work maintains strict adherence to privacy-first, offline-first principles.**
